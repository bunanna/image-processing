# image-processing - Scraping, image processing, and data analysis for IXP plots

For Python 3.7+

Dependencies:
numpy, matplotlib, os, datetime, pandas, ruptures, collections, PIL, dateutil, pytesseract, tslib

You will need to install Tesseract OCR. If using Windows, you can use the executable here: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki. The default path in the plot_image_processing script is C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe.

You will also need tslib, which is found here: https://github.com/jehangiramjad/tslib. Place the tslib folder in the same folder that the scripts are located in. The file's name should be tslib; if it is tslib-master, rename to tslib.
